						<img src="assets/img/goal.png" alt="" style="height: 100px">
						<h3>What the project is?</h3>
						<p>Our goal is to help our users be more aware of their spending practices and identify areas in which they may be able to make changes. To achieve this goal, we want users to be able to add spending records and be as specific about these expenditures as possible. By incorporating categories, we can help users identify and consolidate certain types of purchases. Whenever a user desires we can display up to date financial records, as well as allow the users to view specific types of transactions based on those specific categories, amounts, retailer name, and other criteria.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<img src="assets/img/group.png" alt="" style="height: 100px">
						<h3>Who the users are?</h3>
						<p>Our target audience for this app consists of members of the working populace, as well as teenagers in the workforce. Also, these people must have access to an android mobile device in order to be able to use our app. However, persons who have a vested interest in managing their finances and planning for the future may be more interested in our app. Specific features built into the app may also be particularly useful for certain demographics.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<img src="assets/img/value.png" alt="" style="height: 100px">
						<h3>Why the project is valuable?</h3>
						<p>We believe this app will be useful because many people are unaware of where their money goes over the course of a month or more. Additionally, people may be interested in tracking finances for various reasons. Some users may be interested in creating a complete budget, while others may only need to record specific types of expenses. By allowing users to track their spending when itâ€™s most convenient to them we hope to create an app that is an effective solution to any of these problems.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<img src="assets/img/success.png" alt="" style="height: 100px">
						<h3>How we call it success?</h3>
						<p>Our app will be considered successful based on three criteria. First being, we want our users to prefer using our app as opposed to any other form of financial tracking methods. We will determine this by recording consecutive uses and we will review this data periodically. Secondly, we want our app to be easy to use. We should get over 50% positive feedback through the questionnaire survey. If our application is too difficult to use it will no longer be convenient and therefore unsuccessful. Third, our users need to be able to keep track of their finance by group. We can test this by asking users are they aware of which aspects they mostly spent on.</p>

					<h3>Development skills learned</h3>
					<p>We learned how to use git more effectively, how to use layered architecture and how to build applications that use access seams instead of instantiating new objects all the time. We built the real database and learned how to communicate with it. We wrote a lot of tests including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, by which we understood the importance of Test Driven Development. This experience definitely makes it easier for us to adapt to the industry where we need to implement real solutions in production.</p>

					<h3>Change from initial vision</h3>
					<p>We originally planned a much more in depth project when we had 5 group members. Our feature list contained lots of features that were "nice to haves" as we assumed that we would have time to build them. Once we learned that 2 of the members were no longer taking part we narrowed our project scope drastically to compensate. Moving from a full fledged budgeting application to more of a transaction recorder. The app was designed such that it could be extended in the future to contain all the original features we planned.</p>

					<h3>What to keep doing</h3>
					<p>We learned that completing work earlier is better for everyone. Development almost always came with some kind of problem to be overcome and if the core structure is completed well before the release date other team members can help solve those challenges, before they become a massive challenge. I also learned that having in person team meetings is beneficial when the decisions were made in less time and more members understood the goal. The communication among the team vastly increased the work efficiency. </p>
